## About the Roadmap

It's been while from the first devlog video. I showed an roadmap image in that video, and I failed it! The main reason was the Istanbul earthquake just happened after the first devlog video released. I left the city for a while. Then I got an internship opportunity at a good cyber security company while all that happens. It took some time for me to settle things down and again start developing.

This also teached me that very planned roadmap not suitable for me. I'm 24, my surrouindings are full with oppurtunities and I need a flex workplan. What I want is being more transparent with the development and rapid prototypes with the community.



## First Ever Map: Istanbul

The big reveal… The very first map of Harvested will be set in Istanbul!
I already touched on landmarks and handcrafted maps in the first devlog video, and now the plan is to create a small section of Istanbul as the starting demo. Think of it as a playground—somewhere players can test mechanics, get a feel for the city’s atmosphere, and help us refine the art style.

Right now, all the buildings are still gray boxes. The upcoming playtests will focus on how the gameplay feels inside this rough version of the map. Based on your feedback, these gray blocks will gradually evolve into detailed environments.

The map is already massive. It’s built on a 4096x4096 resolution, and it takes me a full 15 minutes to walk from one edge to the other (yes, I tested it). Considering that for a while game won't have vehicles, for sure map size will be reduced to 2048x2048 or even 1024x1024.

## Weapon Sway

## Ragdoll Improvements

Player body collisions remade in a way suits better for a cubic character. When players dies they do not glitch and bounce around anymore. Also bullets apply force correctly based on their velocity.

## More Precise Bone Collision

Damage hitbox for the players replaced from capsule collider to bone collisions which means now it's possible to shot bullets through the between player's legs. This update also will let us add headshots or damaging limbs in the future.
