# Harvested Devlog 02

New map, fps mechanic improvements and more...

## About the Roadmap

It's been while from the first devlog video. I showed an roadmap image in that video, and I failed it! The main reason was the Istanbul earthquake just happened after the first devlog video released. I left the city for a while. Then I got an internship opportunity at a good cyber security company while all that happens. It took some time for me to settle things down and again start developing.

This also teached me that very planned roadmap not suitable for me. I'm 24, my surrouindings are full with oppurtunities and I need a flex workplan. What I want is being more transparent with the development and rapid prototypes with the community.
